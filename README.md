# cyf-preloader

Very naive preloader for Create Your Frisk mods

# Installation

> To use, copy these files to Lua/Libraries/Preloader and copy Lua/Libraries/Preloader/progressBarBack.png to the Sprites/Preloader folder
>
> Then simply add this to the end of your encounter script:

```lua
require "Libraries/Preloader/preloader"
```

# Usage Tips

> It is suggested to not play music first and make the old EncounterStarting function play some music after (it is tricky to implement)

And I suggest you to check out the preloader.lua file after installation. It can be helpful.
